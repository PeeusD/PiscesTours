<b>Daman and diu</b></h1>
<br>For over 450 years, the coastal exclaves of Daman and Diu on the Arabian Sea coast were part of Portuguese India, along with Goa and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Goa, Daman, and Diu were incorporated into the Republic of India on 19 December 1961 by military conquest. Portugal did not recognise the Indian annexation of these territories until 1974.

The territory of "Goa, Daman, and Diu" were administered as a single union territory until 1987, when Goa was granted statehood, leaving Daman and Diu as a separate union territory. Each enclave constitutes one of the union territory's two districts. Daman and Diu are approximately 640 kilometres away from each other.

English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Marathi are the official[1] and main languages.[2][3] The use of Portuguese is in decline because it is no longer taught at school, though a number of elderly people can still understand it, some even preferring to speak it at home. In addition to standard Portuguese, there are also two declining Portuguese-based creole languages in Daman (known as Língua da Casa, "Home Language") and Diu (Língua dos Velhos, "Elders' Language"). English is increasingly accepted for official purposes.
